## What Is Titan Global Connector?

Titan Global Connector is the infrastructure layer that sits **above** Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe — routing AI agent transactions across multiple payment rails dynamically, in real time, based on cost, speed, reliability, and geographic availability.

Where every major payment processor is locked to their own single rail, Titan Global Connector is **vendor-neutral** — selecting the optimal payment path autonomously across 7 rails and 10 countries.

## Why Multi-Rail?

Single-rail payment processors fail when:
- A rail goes down in a specific region
- Currency conversion costs spike
- An AI agent operates cross-border
- Transaction volume triggers rate limits

Titan Global Connector eliminates single points of failure by dynamically arbitrating across all available rails in real time.
